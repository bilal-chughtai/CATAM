We first put A in  ref form as B
%we then calculate the l values for each row, setting it to 0 if no 1
%Then we calculate rank of the matrix r, by seeing how many 0 rows we have
%By rank nullity, we know n=columns-r = number of free variables
%if n=0 then kernel is 0

%we then determine the free and fixed x_i. The i in the set l are fixed and
%the rest are free. We set in each loop a different free variable to 1,
%zeroing the whole vector x beforehand
%we loop through every row of the ref matrix. a row with 0's contains sno
%information so we skip
%A row ending in a 1 just tells us x_columns=0 which we already have set so
%skip
%for all other rows i, we have some information about x_l(i)
% loop from j=l(i)+1 to columns
%   x(l(i))=x(l(i))-B(i,j)*x(j)
%we then add the vector x to a kernel matrix as a column and move onto
%setting another x_i to 1
%finally we swap rows in reverse in B
